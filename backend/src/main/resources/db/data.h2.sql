(16, 'Given a set of spatial objects O, the search radius r and the submodular function f are specified by the user. The best region search (BRS) is to find an optimal area with fixed range size, in which the object set has the maximum submodular function value. The BRS problem has long been studied because of its wide application in spatial data mining, facility locating and so on. However, most of the existing work focus on either Euclidean space or motionless objects, which is not applicable in many real-life cases. In this paper, we propose the best region monitoring problem in the spatial data streams in road networks (MBRS). Many real life applications can obtain benefit from MBRS problem, such as monitoring traffic and tracking in ecology. We first propose an efficient algorithm to the static BRS problem in road networks, and extend the solution to a naive method to solve the MBRS problem. Then, we put forward effective pruning strategies and branch-and-bound algorithm GER on the basis of the preprocessing to monitor best region at different times. Finally, a large number of experiments verify the efficiency of the proposed method.', DATE '2019-04-25', 'Data & Knowledge Engineering', NULL, '120', 0, 0, '100 - 118', 0.0, NULL, 2019, NULL, 'CHEN2019100', 'Monitoring best region in spatial data streams in road networks', 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X18303951', 11, 1),
(24, 'Big data has been considered to be a breakthrough technological development over recent years. Notwithstanding, we have as yet limited understanding of how organizations translate its potential into actual social and economic value. We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model.', DATE '2019-04-25', 'The Journal of Strategic Information Systems', '3', '26', 0, 0, '191 - 209', 0.0, NULL, 2017, NULL, 'GUNTHER2017191', 'Debating big data: A literature review on realizing value from big data', 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868717302615', 3, 1),
(33, 'Size is the first, and at times, the only dimension that leaps out at the mention of big data. This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper''s primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.', DATE '2019-04-25', 'International Journal of Information Management', '2', '35', 0, 0, '137 - 144', 0.0, NULL, 2015, NULL, 'GANDOMI2015137', 'Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics', 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401214001066', 3, 1);

(68, 'Contamination of water with the zoonotic pathogen Escherichia coli O157 can have severe public health implications and has led to many large disease outbreaks. Although the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants is the recognised reservoir of this organism, E. coli O157 can persist for significant periods of time in animal manure and contaminated soil, from where it can be transferred to watercourses during periods of heavy rainfall. Freshwater ecosystems are often at the interface between agriculture and the wider environment and can play an important role in human exposure to E. coli O157, e.g. though contaminating drinking water, recreational surface waters and shellfish harvesting areas. To mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, it is essential to have a rapid, robust and reproducible method for the detection of waterborne E. coli O157. Because of the very low infective dose and the high background levels of non-target microbes, detection methods need to be extremely sensitive, and display a high level of specificity. In this review, we briefly outline the environmental pathways for the movement of E. coli O157 into watercourses, and critically assess the methods that are currently used to detect E. coli O157 in freshwater systems.

Relevant symptom data were extracted from a self-report questionnaire designed to parallel the WHIPLASHED interview questions. A score of \u22655 on WHIPLASHED was defined as a positive screen for bipolar spectrum disorder by its developer. We examined the capacity of self-reported WHIPLASHED scores \u22655 to differentiate bipolar from unipolar depression in women. Diagnostic assessments were conducted with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.\nResults\n: Women were diagnosed with unipolar (n\u202f=\u202f54) and bipolar (n\u202f=\u202f28) depression. The majority of subjects were white (67%), employed (68%) and married (57%) with a mean age of 36.8 years. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that WHIPLASHED had strong predictive ability (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.877) in differentiating bipolar from unipolar depression.

Findings are compared to those previously observed for [125I]-(E)-1-(2-(2,3-dimethoxy-5-yl)ethyl)-4-(iodoallyl)piperazine ([125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE).\nMethods\nSyntheses of E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE and [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE were accomplished by standard methods. In vitro receptor binding studies and autoradiography were performed, and binding potential was predicted. Measurements of lipophilicity and protein binding were obtained. In vivo studies were conducted in mice to evaluate radioligand stability, as well as specific binding to \u03c31 sites in brain, brain regions and peripheral organs in the presence and absence of potential blockers.\nResults\nE-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE exhibited high affinity and selectivity for \u03c31 receptors (Ki = 0.43 \u00b1 0.03 nM, \u03c32/\u03c31 = 173). [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE was prepared in good yield and purity, with high specific activity. Radioligand binding provided dissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants, along with a measured Kd of 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 nM and Bmax of 472 \u00b1 13 fmol/mg protein. The radioligand proved suitable for quantitative autoradiography in vitro using brain sections. Moderate lipophilicity, Log D7.4 2.69 \u00b1 0.28, was determined, and protein binding was 71 \u00b1 0.3%. In vivo, high initial whole brain uptake, >6% injected dose/g, cleared slowly over 24 h. Specific binding represented 75% to 93% of total binding from 15 min to 24 h. Findings were confirmed and extended by regional brain biodistribution. Radiometabolites were not observed in brain (1%).\nConclusions\nSubstitution of dihydrobenzofuranylethyl for dimethoxyphenethyl increased radioligand affinity for \u03c31 receptors by 16-fold. While high specific binding to \u03c31 receptors was observed for both radioligands in vivo, [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE displayed much slower clearance kinetics than [125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE.

This allows introducing the standard definitions and terminology used in this field. It introduces ensembles of codes defined by sparse random graphs and discusses their most basic property \u2013 the weight distribution.

One potential challenge to the structural integrity of the RPV in a pressurized water reactor is posed by pressurized thermal shock (PTS). Therefore, the safety of the RPV with regard to neutron embrittlement has to be analyzed. In this paper, the procedure and method for the structural integrity analysis of RPV subjected to PTS are presented. FAVOR and PASCAL, two computer codes widely used for the probabilistic analysis of RPV subjected to PTS, are briefly reviewed and compared. By using FAVOR, a benchmark example is presented to show the procedure and method for the integrity analysis. The influence of warm prestressing (WPS), fracture toughness and constraint effect on the integrity analysis of RPV is discussed. The Master Curve method is more realistic than the ASME model to consider the analysis of fracture toughness and thus is recommended.

Hence, from the network perspective, the impairment-aware routing, spectrum and core assignment (IA-RSCA) problem is the most important concern of MCF-EONs. In this paper, we propose a XT-aware greedy algorithm to minimize the XT impact on the MCF-EONs performance. To achieve the XT impact minimization, we decompose the IA-RSCA problem into two sub-problems: the IA routing sub-problem and the IA spectrum and core assignment (IA-SCA) sub-problem. For the routing solution, a pre-computation method based on the k-shortest path is used, and a physical layer impairment verification phase is performed taking the required optical signal to noise ratio into account. For the IA-SCA sub-problem, the novel XT-aware greedy algorithm is used to minimize the XT impact on the MCF-EONs performance as follows: for each new connection, the level of detected XT power of the new connection and interfering connections relative to the XT power threshold of each connection is minimized on the average over all those connections. This minimization is achieved by choosing the core and frequency slot of the new connection. In order to take the spectral overlapping extension of the new and interfering connections into account in the detected XT power, a novel frequency slot overlapping index is introduced. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through computer simulations. The results show that the total blocking probability and network average utilization achieved by the proposed algorithm are better than the ones obtained by core prioritization, random and first-fit strategies, for different scenarios of XT level and spectrum fragmentation.', DATE '2019-04-25', 'Optical Switching and Networking', NULL, '33', 0, 0, '61 - 73', 0.0, NULL, 2019, NULL, 'LOBATO201961', 'Inter-core crosstalk aware greedy algorithm for spectrum and core assignment in space division multiplexed elastic optical networks', 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573427718301589', 3, 1);

As a variety of complementary microscopy approaches rather than a specific type of instrument, correlative microscopy has blossomed in recent years as researchers have recognised that it is particularly suited to address the intricate questions of the modern biological sciences. Specialised technical developments in sample preparation, imaging methods, visualisation and data analysis have also accelerated the uptake of correlative approaches. In light of these advances, this critical review takes the reader on a journey through recent developments in, and applications of, correlative microscopy, examining its impact in biomedical research and in the field of plant science.

Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or \u2018locked in\u2019, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10\u201325bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.'), DATE '2019-04-25', 'Clinical Neurophysiology', '6', '113', 0, 0, '767 - 791', 0.0, NULL, 2002, NULL, 'WOLPAW2002767', STRINGDECODE('Brain\u2013computer interfaces for communication and control'), 'http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245702000573', 3, 2);

Existing TE solutions mainly focus on routing traffic along shortest paths between source and destination nodes, but ignore the likely network congestion. With the emergence of Software Defined Networking (SDN), through the deployment of SDN switches, we can enable flexible routing by splitting flows arbitrarily among multi-paths. However, due to technical, organizational and economical challenges of full SDN deployment, deploying SDN incrementally may be a more practical solution. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a hybrid SDN architecture, where both legacy routers and SDN switches coexist. To explore routing optimization of TE in a hybrid SDN, we formulate a Mixed Integer Non-Linear programming (MINLP) problem and propose a heuristic algorithm SOTE to jointly optimize the OSPF weight setting and traffic splitting ratio of SDN nodes. Through extensive simulation and implementation on our prototyped testbed, we demonstrate that SOTE outperforms other algorithms in minimizing the maximum link utilization (MLU) of a network.
