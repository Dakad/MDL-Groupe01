The best region search (BRS) is to find an optimal area with fixed range size, in which the object set has the maximum submodular function value. The BRS problem has long been studied because of its wide application in spatial data mining, facility locating and so on. However, most of the existing work focus on either Euclidean space or motionless objects, which is not applicable in many real-life cases. In this paper, we propose the best region monitoring problem in the spatial data streams in road networks (MBRS). Many real life applications can obtain benefit from MBRS problem, such as monitoring traffic and tracking in ecology. We first propose an efficient algorithm to the static BRS problem in road networks, and extend the solution to a naive method to solve the MBRS problem. Then, we put forward effective pruning strategies and branch-and-bound algorithm GER on the basis of the preprocessing to monitor best region at different times. Finally, a large number of experiments verify the efficiency of the proposed method.','2018-12-04','Data & Knowledge Engineering',NULL,'120',0,0,'100 - 118',0,NULL,2019,NULL,'CHEN2019100','Monitoring best region in spatial data streams in road networks','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X18303951',11,1),(25,'Big data has been considered to be a breakthrough technological development over recent years.

This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper\'s primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.','2017-07-04','International Journal of Information Management','2','35',0,0,'137 - 144',0,NULL,2015,NULL,'GANDOMI2015137','Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401214001066',3,1),(41,'Dynamo: a public interactive surface supporting the cooperative sharing and exchange of media','2015-05-05','Proceedings of the 16th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology',NULL,NULL,0,0,'159--168',0,NULL,2003,NULL,'izadi2003dynamo','Dynamo: a public interactive surface supporting the cooperative sharing and exchange of media','http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/964696.964714',6,2),(47,'GVoS: A General System for Near-Duplicate Video-Related Applications on Storm','2018-10-07','ACM Trans.

Although the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants is the recognised reservoir of this organism, E. coli O157 can persist for significant periods of time in animal manure and contaminated soil, from where it can be transferred to watercourses during periods of heavy rainfall. Freshwater ecosystems are often at the interface between agriculture and the wider environment and can play an important role in human exposure to E. coli O157, e.g. though contaminating drinking water, recreational surface waters and shellfish harvesting areas. To mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, it is essential to have a rapid, robust and reproducible method for the detection of waterborne E. coli O157. Because of the very low infective dose and the high background levels of non-target microbes, detection methods need to be extremely sensitive, and display a high level of specificity. In this review, we briefly outline the environmental pathways for the movement of E. coli O157 into watercourses, and critically assess the methods that are currently used to detect E. coli O157 in freshwater systems. Finally, we determine the suitability of each method for the rapid, accurate and affordable detection of waterborne E. coli O157 and consider some future directions for detecting human pathogens in the environment.','2019-05-04','Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment','3','140',0,0,'354 - 360',0,NULL,2011,NULL,'QUILLIAM2011354','Unearthing human pathogens at the agricultural–environment interface: A review of current methods for the detection of Escherichia coli O157 in freshwater ecosystems','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167880911000375',12,2),(81,'Dysfunctional Defecation: “Why ‘Jane’ Can’t Poop!”','2018-09-12','AWHONN Lifelines','6','5',0,0,'50 - 55',0,NULL,2001,NULL,'RICCI200150','Dysfunctional Defecation: “Why ‘Jane’ Can’t Poop!”','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1091592315305136',12,2),(83,'To Poop or Not to Poop: A Multi-Sensory Learning Experience in Constipation Management (FR482D)','2019-05-04','Journal of Pain and Symptom Management','2','57',0,0,'438 - 439',0,NULL,2019,NULL,'NICHOLS2019438','To Poop or Not to Poop: A Multi-Sensory Learning Experience in Constipation Management (FR482D)','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392418312892',12,2),(85,'Poop in the Pericardium: A Review and Case Report of Colopericardial Fistulas','2019-05-04','Chest','4, Supplement ','142',0,0,'41A',0,NULL,2012,NULL,'COTTON201241A','Poop in the Pericardium: A Review and Case Report of Colopericardial Fistulas','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369216549113',12,1),(89,'The Sweet Smell of Success Pooper-Scooper Cam','2019-05-04','Killer Camera Rigs That You Can Build (Third Edition)',NULL,'Third Edition',0,0,'158 - 167',0,NULL,2010,'Focal Press','SELAKOVICH2010158','The Sweet Smell of Success Pooper-Scooper Cam','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780240813370000124',12,1),(91,'The cell cycle of hypothesis of neural dysfunction in chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) offers a unified approach to understanding both existing and novel strategies for drug development.

We have pursued a ligand based approach on the basis of public domain data to identify existing compounds capable of abrogating the cell cycle at the G0–G1 interface. Selected on this basis, irrespective of the tissue under study, we identified several classes of compounds as potential chemical leads. Of these compounds, at least ten have already been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of acute neurodegeneration. Such compounds could form the basis of a screening exercise after development of suitable screening tools. Progressing of chemical leads through such an approach will be more efficient if future leads display relevant “drug-like” properties.

Relevant symptom data were extracted from a self-report questionnaire designed to parallel the WHIPLASHED interview questions. A score of ≥5 on WHIPLASHED was defined as a positive screen for bipolar spectrum disorder by its developer. We examined the capacity of self-reported WHIPLASHED scores ≥5 to differentiate bipolar from unipolar depression in women. Diagnostic assessments were conducted with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.\nResults\n: Women were diagnosed with unipolar (n = 54) and bipolar (n = 28) depression. The majority of subjects were white (67%), employed (68%) and married (57%) with a mean age of 36.8 years. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that WHIPLASHED had strong predictive ability (AUC = 0.877) in differentiating bipolar from unipolar depression. A cutoff score of ≥5 generated 96% sensitivity and 52% specificity, while raising the threshold to 6 generated 89% sensitivity and 76% specificity for a bipolar disorder diagnosis.\nLimitations\n: Our sample was small and composed of female patients at a single treatment center.\nConclusions\n: In this sample, WHIPLASHED was a valid screening tool to differentiate bipolar from unipolar depression.

Initial study measures were completed by 222 caregivers. Following item reduction, 18 items were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent and criterion validity were assessed using correlation. Reliability was established using internal consistency statistics and test–retest reliability at baseline and 2-week follow-up.\nResults\nA five factor first-order structure with two higher-order factors demonstrated acceptable fit to the data, was consistent with a priori hypotheses, and was more parsimonious than the alternative model.

Findings are compared to those previously observed for [125I]-(E)-1-(2-(2,3-dimethoxy-5-yl)ethyl)-4-(iodoallyl)piperazine ([125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE).\nMethods\nSyntheses of E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE and [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE were accomplished by standard methods. In vitro receptor binding studies and autoradiography were performed, and binding potential was predicted. Measurements of lipophilicity and protein binding were obtained. In vivo studies were conducted in mice to evaluate radioligand stability, as well as specific binding to σ1 sites in brain, brain regions and peripheral organs in the presence and absence of potential blockers.\nResults\nE-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE exhibited high affinity and selectivity for σ1 receptors (Ki = 0.43 ± 0.03 nM, σ2/σ1 = 173). [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE was prepared in good yield and purity, with high specific activity. Radioligand binding provided dissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants, along with a measured Kd of 0.24 ± 0.01 nM and Bmax of 472 ± 13 fmol/mg protein. The radioligand proved suitable for quantitative autoradiography in vitro using brain sections. Moderate lipophilicity, Log D7.4 2.69 ± 0.28, was determined, and protein binding was 71 ± 0.3%. In vivo, high initial whole brain uptake, >6% injected dose/g, cleared slowly over 24 h. Specific binding represented 75% to 93% of total binding from 15 min to 24 h. Findings were confirmed and extended by regional brain biodistribution. Radiometabolites were not observed in brain (1%).\nConclusions\nSubstitution of dihydrobenzofuranylethyl for dimethoxyphenethyl increased radioligand affinity for σ1 receptors by 16-fold. While high specific binding to σ1 receptors was observed for both radioligands in vivo, [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE displayed much slower clearance kinetics than [125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE.

From these three examples, I then attempt to articulate the major differences between dynamical approaches and more traditional symbolic and connectionist approaches. Although the three models reviewed here vary considerably in their details, they share a focus on the unfolding trajectory of a system’s state and the internal and external forces that shape this trajectory, rather than the representational content of its constituent states or the underlying physical mechanisms that instantiate the dynamics.

The central problem of communications is how to transmit information reliably through a noisy and thus, an unreliable communication channel. Coding theory aims at accomplishing this task by adding a properly designed redundancy to the transmitted message. This redundancy is then used at the receiver to reconstruct the original message despite the noise introduced by the channel. The chapter gives a brief outline of the (channel coding) problem. This allows introducing the standard definitions and terminology used in this field. It introduces ensembles of codes defined by sparse random graphs and discusses their most basic property – the weight distribution.

One potential challenge to the structural integrity of the RPV in a pressurized water reactor is posed by pressurized thermal shock (PTS). Therefore, the safety of the RPV with regard to neutron embrittlement has to be analyzed. In this paper, the procedure and method for the structural integrity analysis of RPV subjected to PTS are presented. FAVOR and PASCAL, two computer codes widely used for the probabilistic analysis of RPV subjected to PTS, are briefly reviewed and compared. By using FAVOR, a benchmark example is presented to show the procedure and method for the integrity analysis. The influence of warm prestressing (WPS), fracture toughness and constraint effect on the integrity analysis of RPV is discussed. The Master Curve method is more realistic than the ASME model to consider the analysis of fracture toughness and thus is recommended.

Hence, from the network perspective, the impairment-aware routing, spectrum and core assignment (IA-RSCA) problem is the most important concern of MCF-EONs. In this paper, we propose a XT-aware greedy algorithm to minimize the XT impact on the MCF-EONs performance. To achieve the XT impact minimization, we decompose the IA-RSCA problem into two sub-problems: the IA routing sub-problem and the IA spectrum and core assignment (IA-SCA) sub-problem. For the routing solution, a pre-computation method based on the k-shortest path is used, and a physical layer impairment verification phase is performed taking the required optical signal to noise ratio into account. For the IA-SCA sub-problem, the novel XT-aware greedy algorithm is used to minimize the XT impact on the MCF-EONs performance as follows: for each new connection, the level of detected XT power of the new connection and interfering connections relative to the XT power threshold of each connection is minimized on the average over all those connections. This minimization is achieved by choosing the core and frequency slot of the new connection. In order to take the spectral overlapping extension of the new and interfering connections into account in the detected XT power, a novel frequency slot overlapping index is introduced. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through computer simulations. The results show that the total blocking probability and network average utilization achieved by the proposed algorithm are better than the ones obtained by core prioritization, random and first-fit strategies, for different scenarios of XT level and spectrum fragmentation.','2019-05-04','Optical Switching and Networking',NULL,'33',0,0,'61 - 73',0,NULL,2019,NULL,'LOBATO201961','Inter-core crosstalk aware greedy algorithm for spectrum and core assignment in space division multiplexed elastic optical networks','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1573427718301589',3,2),(280,'Correlative microscopy is the application of two or more distinct microscopy techniques to the same region of a sample, generating complementary morphological, structural and chemical information that exceeds what is possible with any single technique.

Specialised technical developments in sample preparation, imaging methods, visualisation and data analysis have also accelerated the uptake of correlative approaches. In light of these advances, this critical review takes the reader on a journey through recent developments in, and applications of, correlative microscopy, examining its impact in biomedical research and in the field of plant science.

Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or ‘locked in’, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10–25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.','2019-05-04','Clinical Neurophysiology','6','113',0,0,'767 - 791',0,NULL,2002,NULL,'WOLPAW2002767','Brain–computer interfaces for communication and control','http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245702000573',3,2),(314,'Computer vision systems are being used increasingly in the food industry for quality assurance purposes.

New software engineering need to move away from the traditional execution models and reconsider the principles from ground up - focusing on the three primary “building criteria” of modern applications, namely to process information, to adhere to quality and performance criteria, and to follow business incentives.

Existing TE solutions mainly focus on routing traffic along shortest paths between source and destination nodes, but ignore the likely network congestion. With the emergence of Software Defined Networking (SDN), through the deployment of SDN switches, we can enable flexible routing by splitting flows arbitrarily among multi-paths. However, due to technical, organizational and economical challenges of full SDN deployment, deploying SDN incrementally may be a more practical solution. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a hybrid SDN architecture, where both legacy routers and SDN switches coexist. To explore routing optimization of TE in a hybrid SDN, we formulate a Mixed Integer Non-Linear programming (MINLP) problem and propose a heuristic algorithm SOTE to jointly optimize the OSPF weight setting and traffic splitting ratio of SDN nodes. Through extensive simulation and implementation on our prototyped testbed, we demonstrate that SOTE outperforms other algorithms in minimizing the maximum link utilization (MLU) of a network.
