    "content": "Given a set of spatial objects O, the search radius r and the submodular function f are specified by the user. The best region search (BRS) is to find an optimal area with fixed range size, in which the object set has the maximum submodular function value. The BRS problem has long been studied because of its wide application in spatial data mining, facility locating and so on. However, most of the existing work focus on either Euclidean space or motionless objects, which is not applicable in many real-life cases. In this paper, we propose the best region monitoring problem in the spatial data streams in road networks (MBRS). Many real life applications can obtain benefit from MBRS problem, such as monitoring traffic and tracking in ecology. We first propose an efficient algorithm to the static BRS problem in road networks, and extend the solution to a naive method to solve the MBRS problem. Then, we put forward effective pruning strategies and branch-and-bound algorithm GER on the basis of the preprocessing to monitor best region at different times. Finally, a large number of experiments verify the efficiency of the proposed method.",

Notwithstanding, we have as yet limited understanding of how organizations translate its potential into actual social and economic value. We conduct an in-depth systematic review of IS literature on the topic and identify six debates central to how organizations realize value from big data, at different levels of analysis. Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data. We synthesize the findings by means of an integrated model.",

This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.",

    "content": "Contamination of water with the zoonotic pathogen Escherichia coli O157 can have severe public health implications and has led to many large disease outbreaks. Although the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants is the recognised reservoir of this organism, E. coli O157 can persist for significant periods of time in animal manure and contaminated soil, from where it can be transferred to watercourses during periods of heavy rainfall. Freshwater ecosystems are often at the interface between agriculture and the wider environment and can play an important role in human exposure to E. coli O157, e.g. though contaminating drinking water, recreational surface waters and shellfish harvesting areas. To mitigate the risk of disease outbreaks, it is essential to have a rapid, robust and reproducible method for the detection of waterborne E. coli O157. Because of the very low infective dose and the high background levels of non-target microbes, detection methods need to be extremely sensitive, and display a high level of specificity. In this review, we briefly outline the environmental pathways for the movement of E. coli O157 into watercourses, and critically assess the methods that are currently used to detect E. coli O157 in freshwater systems. Finally, we determine the suitability of each method for the rapid, accurate and affordable detection of waterborne E. coli O157 and consider some future directions for detecting human pathogens in the environment.",

At the present time, a ligand based approach is a pragmatic solution for identifying new chemical leads on which to base future discovery and optimisation. We have pursued a ligand based approach on the basis of public domain data to identify existing compounds capable of abrogating the cell cycle at the G0–G1 interface. Selected on this basis, irrespective of the tissue under study, we identified several classes of compounds as potential chemical leads. Of these compounds, at least ten have already been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of acute neurodegeneration. Such compounds could form the basis of a screening exercise after development of suitable screening tools. Progressing of chemical leads through such an approach will be more efficient if future leads display relevant “drug-like” properties. Further, drug development in this arena should take account of the special concerns raised by targeting an elderly population. This will involve accounting for frequent polypharmacy in the aging population, and age-related alterations in physiology.",

The inhibitor method has been used to measure the rate of initiation by benzoyl peroxide and POOH groups. POOP peroxide groups are formed in addition to POOH during the oxidation of PP and PE at a rate corresponding to the number of chain terminations. Depending on the conditions of oxidation, the quantity of POOH and POOP groups formed is equal to or less than the amount of O2 absorbed. Two kinds of POOH are formed in PP: groups in blocks that decompose rapidly and individual groups that decompose slowly. It is shown that POOH in PP is induced to decompose under the action of alkyl macroradicals both in an inert atmosphere and also under conditions of oxidation. Quantitative characteristics have been obtained for the thermal and induced decomposition of POOH. The yield of radicals into the volume during the decomposition of block POOH in PP is equal to 0·12 (92, 114°C).",

    "content": "Background\n: The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of the WHIPLASHED clinician-administered interview, a mnemonic of questions on clinical factors and illness course used to screen for bipolar disorder, as a self-report questionnaire.\nMethods\n: Participants (n = 82) were females recruited from an outpatient academic women's mental health clinic. Relevant symptom data were extracted from a self-report questionnaire designed to parallel the WHIPLASHED interview questions. A score of ≥5 on WHIPLASHED was defined as a positive screen for bipolar spectrum disorder by its developer. We examined the capacity of self-reported WHIPLASHED scores ≥5 to differentiate bipolar from unipolar depression in women. Diagnostic assessments were conducted with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview.\nResults\n: Women were diagnosed with unipolar (n = 54) and bipolar (n = 28) depression. The majority of subjects were white (67%), employed (68%) and married (57%) with a mean age of 36.8 years. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that WHIPLASHED had strong predictive ability (AUC = 0.877) in differentiating bipolar from unipolar depression. A cutoff score of ≥5 generated 96% sensitivity and 52% specificity, while raising the threshold to 6 generated 89% sensitivity and 76% specificity for a bipolar disorder diagnosis.\nLimitations\n: Our sample was small and composed of female patients at a single treatment center.\nConclusions\n: In this sample, WHIPLASHED was a valid screening tool to differentiate bipolar from unipolar depression. While existing instruments focus on primary symptoms of bipolar disorder, the WHIPLASHED is useful in exploring subtypes of bipolar disorder in which depression dominates the clinical course.",

We sought to develop and validate the Cincinnati Fecal Incontinence Scale (CINCY-FIS) as a psychometrically valid measure to assess the quality of life and caregiver impacts of pediatric fecal incontinence.\nMethods\nItems were generated through review of previous measures, expert consensus, and pilot testing with feedback from 8 families. Initial study measures were completed by 222 caregivers. Following item reduction, 18 items were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. Convergent and criterion validity were assessed using correlation. Reliability was established using internal consistency statistics and test–retest reliability at baseline and 2-week follow-up.\nResults\nA five factor first-order structure with two higher-order factors demonstrated acceptable fit to the data, was consistent with a priori hypotheses, and was more parsimonious than the alternative model. Convergent validity and criterion-related validity were established for all of the CINCY-FIS scales. Reliability was high and consistent across both measurement occasions.\nConclusions\nThe CINCY-FIS is a reliable and valid assessment of pediatric fecal incontinence-specific quality of life and parenting stress. The score is highly sensitive to patient changes making it suitable for both clinical and research purposes.\nType of Study\nProspective observational.\nLevel of Evidence\nStudy of Diagnostic Test Level II.",

The main purpose of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis of the association between Internet addiction (IA) and a number of personal and social psychological factors in adolescents.\nMethods\nThe search included cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies which analyzed the relationship between IA and at least one of the following personal variables: (i) psychopathology, (ii) personality features and (iii) social difficulties, as well as (iv) self-esteem, (v) social skills and (vi) positive family functioning. These variables were classified as protective and promoting factors of the risk of developing IA.\nResults\nA total of 28 studies with adequate methodological quality were identified in the primary medical, health and psychological literature databases up to November 2017. Of the 48,090 students included in the analysis, 6548 (13.62%) were identified as excessive Internet users. The results highlight that risk factors had a greater effect on IA than protective factors. Also, personal factors showed a greater link with IA than social factors.\nConclusions\nThe data provide relevant information for those developing programs for the prevention of IA and the enhancement of protective factors.",

Our study provides both quantitative and qualitative data from Catalonia, Northeast Spain. We provide historical trends in forest expansion; an assessment of technological, socio-economic and ecological options of forest management; and plausible scenarios of its future evolution. Results show that while the opportunities and stakes are high, in Mediterranean countries, specific socio-ecologic factors need to be taken into account if forest biomass is to contribute decisively to securing renewable sources of energy in Europe, integrating landscape planning with resource policies or mitigating climate change. Among these key factors identified are property regimes, low productivity of Mediterranean forests and weak institutional capacity. Other elements such as logistics and supply difficulties and the lack of economic profitability of forest products constitute limitations identified in the implementation of bioenergy systems. Technological solutions alone, while important, are insufficient to ensure a prominent role of Southern Europe forest biomass management in the climate, landscape and sustainability energy policy challenge.",

Findings are compared to those previously observed for [125I]-(E)-1-(2-(2,3-dimethoxy-5-yl)ethyl)-4-(iodoallyl)piperazine ([125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE).\nMethods\nSyntheses of E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE and [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE were accomplished by standard methods. In vitro receptor binding studies and autoradiography were performed, and binding potential was predicted. Measurements of lipophilicity and protein binding were obtained. In vivo studies were conducted in mice to evaluate radioligand stability, as well as specific binding to σ1 sites in brain, brain regions and peripheral organs in the presence and absence of potential blockers.\nResults\nE-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE exhibited high affinity and selectivity for σ1 receptors (Ki = 0.43 ± 0.03 nM, σ2/σ1 = 173). [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE was prepared in good yield and purity, with high specific activity. Radioligand binding provided dissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants, along with a measured Kd of 0.24 ± 0.01 nM and Bmax of 472 ± 13 fmol/mg protein. The radioligand proved suitable for quantitative autoradiography in vitro using brain sections. Moderate lipophilicity, Log D7.4 2.69 ± 0.28, was determined, and protein binding was 71 ± 0.3%. In vivo, high initial whole brain uptake, >6% injected dose/g, cleared slowly over 24 h. Specific binding represented 75% to 93% of total binding from 15 min to 24 h. Findings were confirmed and extended by regional brain biodistribution. Radiometabolites were not observed in brain (1%).\nConclusions\nSubstitution of dihydrobenzofuranylethyl for dimethoxyphenethyl increased radioligand affinity for σ1 receptors by 16-fold. While high specific binding to σ1 receptors was observed for both radioligands in vivo, [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE displayed much slower clearance kinetics than [125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE. Thus, minor structural modifications of σ1 receptor radioligands lead to major differences in binding properties in vitro and in vivo.",

From these three examples, I then attempt to articulate the major differences between dynamical approaches and more traditional symbolic and connectionist approaches. Although the three models reviewed here vary considerably in their details, they share a focus on the unfolding trajectory of a system’s state and the internal and external forces that shape this trajectory, rather than the representational content of its constituent states or the underlying physical mechanisms that instantiate the dynamics. In some work, this dynamical viewpoint is augmented with a situated and embodied perspective on cognition, forming a promising unified theoretical framework for cognitive science broadly construed.",

The central problem of communications is how to transmit information reliably through a noisy and thus, an unreliable communication channel. Coding theory aims at accomplishing this task by adding a properly designed redundancy to the transmitted message. This redundancy is then used at the receiver to reconstruct the original message despite the noise introduced by the channel. The chapter gives a brief outline of the (channel coding) problem. This allows introducing the standard definitions and terminology used in this field. It introduces ensembles of codes defined by sparse random graphs and discusses their most basic property – the weight distribution. The decoding problem phrased as an inference problem on a graph, and the performance of the efficient (albeit in general suboptimal) message-passing decoder is considered. The chapter shows the performance of such a combination (sparse graph code and message-passing decoding) analyzed and discussed, with respect to the relationship of the performance under message-passing decoding to the performance of the optimal decoder.",

Number randomised, superiority of treatment versus control (Hedges’g) on primary outcome measure, length of follow-up, follow up outcome, patient adherence and satisfaction/harm were extracted; risk of bias was assessed. A search for studies on effectiveness of iCBT in clinical practice was conducted.\nResults\n64 trials were identified. The mean effect size (efficacy) was g = 0.80 (NNT 2.34), and benefit was evident across all four disorders. Improvement was maintained at follow-with good acceptability. Research probity was good, and bias risk low. In addition, nine studies comparing iCBT with traditional face-to-face CBT and three comparing iCBT with bibliotherapy were identified. All three modes of treatment delivery appeared equally beneficial. The results of effectiveness studies were congruent with the results of the efficacy trials.\nLimitations\nStudies variably measured changes in quality of life and disability, and the lack of comparisons with medications weakens the field.\nConclusions\nThe conclusions drawn in the original meta-analysis are now supported: iCBT for the anxiety and depressive disorders is effective, acceptable and practical health care.",

    "content": "The reactor pressure vessel (RPV), as one of the most important safety barriers of light water reactors, is exposed to neutron irradiation at elevated temperatures, which results in embrittlement of the RPV steel. One potential challenge to the structural integrity of the RPV in a pressurized water reactor is posed by pressurized thermal shock (PTS). Therefore, the safety of the RPV with regard to neutron embrittlement has to be analyzed. In this paper, the procedure and method for the structural integrity analysis of RPV subjected to PTS are presented. FAVOR and PASCAL, two computer codes widely used for the probabilistic analysis of RPV subjected to PTS, are briefly reviewed and compared. By using FAVOR, a benchmark example is presented to show the procedure and method for the integrity analysis. The influence of warm prestressing (WPS), fracture toughness and constraint effect on the integrity analysis of RPV is discussed. The Master Curve method is more realistic than the ASME model to consider the analysis of fracture toughness and thus is recommended. In order to transfer the fracture toughness data from test specimen to the RPV, local approach provides a probabilistic method.",

    "content": "In elastic optical networks (EONs) employing weakly coupled single-mode multi-core fibers (MCFs), inter-core crosstalk (XT) can affect significantly the network performance, particularly when the number of cores and the path length increase. Hence, from the network perspective, the impairment-aware routing, spectrum and core assignment (IA-RSCA) problem is the most important concern of MCF-EONs. In this paper, we propose a XT-aware greedy algorithm to minimize the XT impact on the MCF-EONs performance. To achieve the XT impact minimization, we decompose the IA-RSCA problem into two sub-problems: the IA routing sub-problem and the IA spectrum and core assignment (IA-SCA) sub-problem. For the routing solution, a pre-computation method based on the k-shortest path is used, and a physical layer impairment verification phase is performed taking the required optical signal to noise ratio into account. For the IA-SCA sub-problem, the novel XT-aware greedy algorithm is used to minimize the XT impact on the MCF-EONs performance as follows: for each new connection, the level of detected XT power of the new connection and interfering connections relative to the XT power threshold of each connection is minimized on the average over all those connections. This minimization is achieved by choosing the core and frequency slot of the new connection. In order to take the spectral overlapping extension of the new and interfering connections into account in the detected XT power, a novel frequency slot overlapping index is introduced. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through computer simulations. The results show that the total blocking probability and network average utilization achieved by the proposed algorithm are better than the ones obtained by core prioritization, random and first-fit strategies, for different scenarios of XT level and spectrum fragmentation.",

As a variety of complementary microscopy approaches rather than a specific type of instrument, correlative microscopy has blossomed in recent years as researchers have recognised that it is particularly suited to address the intricate questions of the modern biological sciences. Specialised technical developments in sample preparation, imaging methods, visualisation and data analysis have also accelerated the uptake of correlative approaches. In light of these advances, this critical review takes the reader on a journey through recent developments in, and applications of, correlative microscopy, examining its impact in biomedical research and in the field of plant science. This twin emphasis gives a unique perspective into use of correlative microscopy in fields that often advance independently, and highlights the lessons that can be learned from both fields for the future of this important area of research.",

    "content": "For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world – a brain–computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or ‘locked in’, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10–25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.",

Modern applications have to run distributed, in parallel, on heterogeneous environments, share distributed data etc. Not surprisingly the standard ways of programming do not hold anymore and modern software engineers struggle with the growing complexity. New software engineering need to move away from the traditional execution models and reconsider the principles from ground up - focusing on the three primary “building criteria” of modern applications, namely to process information, to adhere to quality and performance criteria, and to follow business incentives. This paper shows that these three criteria are sufficient to specify the full functional behaviour of an application and thereby implicitly its potential instantiations. Since no single algorithm is bound to the specification, transformation between instances, and thus between different execution attributes is easily possible using mathematical transformations.",

The objective of this paper is to propose a complete framework for the introduction of gamification in software engineering environments. This framework is composed of an ontology, a methodology guiding the process, and a support gamification engine. We carried out a case study in which the proposed framework was applied in a real company. In this project the company used the framework to gamify the areas of project management, requirements management, and testing. As a result, the methodology has clearly enabled the company to introduce gamification in its work environment, achieving a quality solution with appropriate design and development effort. The support tool allowed the company to gamify its current tools very easily.",

Existing TE solutions mainly focus on routing traffic along shortest paths between source and destination nodes, but ignore the likely network congestion. With the emergence of Software Defined Networking (SDN), through the deployment of SDN switches, we can enable flexible routing by splitting flows arbitrarily among multi-paths. However, due to technical, organizational and economical challenges of full SDN deployment, deploying SDN incrementally may be a more practical solution. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a hybrid SDN architecture, where both legacy routers and SDN switches coexist. To explore routing optimization of TE in a hybrid SDN, we formulate a Mixed Integer Non-Linear programming (MINLP) problem and propose a heuristic algorithm SOTE to jointly optimize the OSPF weight setting and traffic splitting ratio of SDN nodes. Through extensive simulation and implementation on our prototyped testbed, we demonstrate that SOTE outperforms other algorithms in minimizing the maximum link utilization (MLU) of a network. Moreover, we also demonstrate that 10% deployment of SDN nodes can reap the most of benefit.",
